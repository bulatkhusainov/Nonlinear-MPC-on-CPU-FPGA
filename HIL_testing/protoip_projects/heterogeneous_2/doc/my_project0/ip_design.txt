IP build report: my_project0
----------------------------------------------------------


Timing:
------------------------

* IP
   target clock period (ns): 10.00
   estimated clock period (ns): 9.58

	* User function
	   target clock period (ns): 10.00
	   estimated clock period (ns): 9.58

Time constraints might be met during IP prototyping. You can reduce clock target period to build a faster design.


Latency:
------------------------

* IP
   latency (clock cycles): 3220
   latency (us): 32.2

	* User function
	   latency (clock cycles): 2724
	   latency (us): 27.24


Resource utilization:
------------------------

   DSP48E: 25 (11%) used out off 220 available.
   FF: 11998 (11%) used out off 106400 available.
   LUT: 18293 (34%) used out off 53200 available.

	* User function
	   BRAM_18K: 32 (11%) used out off 280 available.
	   DSP48E: 25 (11%) used out off 220 available.
	   FF: 8479 (7%) used out off 106400 available.

NOTE: IP design performance might be enhanced by adding directives from Vivado_HLS GUI interface. Run "tclapp::icl::protoip::ip_design_build_debug" to open my_project0 with Vivado_HLS GUI interface.
